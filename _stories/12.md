This is the intent story (s0) for idea 4 – analytics dashboard.

## Why This Idea Exists

Data-driven decisions require visibility into user behavior, system performance, and business metrics. Without analytics:
- We can't understand user needs
- We can't measure feature success
- We can't optimize performance
- We can't make informed decisions

## What Problem It Solves

- Lack of visibility into user behavior
- No way to measure feature adoption
- Performance monitoring gaps
- Business metrics tracking
- A/B testing results

## Expected Outcomes

Stakeholders will be able to:
1. Understand user behavior patterns
2. Measure feature success and adoption
3. Monitor system performance
4. Track business KPIs
5. Make data-driven decisions
