This is the intent story (s0) for idea 6 – microservices architecture.

## Why This Idea Exists

As the platform grows, the monolithic architecture becomes a bottleneck:
- Difficult to scale individual components
- Tight coupling between features
- Deployment risks
- Technology constraints
- Team collaboration challenges

## What Problem It Solves

- Independent scaling of services
- Technology flexibility per service
- Reduced deployment risk
- Better team autonomy
- Improved fault isolation

## Expected Outcomes

The platform will have:
1. Independently deployable services
2. Better scalability
3. Technology diversity
4. Reduced coupling
5. Improved maintainability
