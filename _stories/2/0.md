This is the intent story (s0) for idea 2 – the authentication system.

## Why This Idea Exists

A secure authentication system is foundational to the platform. Without proper authentication, we cannot:
- Protect user data
- Enable personalized experiences
- Implement authorization and access control
- Build trust with users

## What Problem It Solves

- User identity management
- Secure access to platform resources
- Integration with third-party OAuth providers
- Session management and security
- Password management and recovery

## Expected Outcomes

Users will be able to:
1. Register and create accounts securely
2. Log in using multiple methods (email/password, OAuth)
3. Manage their sessions and security settings
4. Recover accounts when needed
5. Trust that their data is protected
