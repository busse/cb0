This is **i0** – the meta-idea representing the site itself. This idea documents the taxonomy system that powers the organization of all ideas, stories, and sprints.

## Purpose

This site uses a zero-based array notation system to track:
- **Ideas** (i{n}) - High-level concepts or projects
- **Stories** (s{n}) - Specific tasks or features within ideas
- **Sprints** ({YYSS}) - Two-week time blocks for planning work
- **Updates** ({sprint}.{idea}.{story}) - Progress entries

## Notation System

| Format | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `i{n}` | Idea n | i5 = Idea 5 |
| `s{n}` | Story n | s56 = Story 56 |
| `{idea}.{story}` | Combined (no prefixes) | 5.56 = Idea 5, Story 56 |
| `{sprint}.{idea}.{story}` | Full reference | 2609.5.56 |

## Special Cases

- **i0** (this idea) = The site itself
- **s0** for any idea = The intent/purpose behind that idea
