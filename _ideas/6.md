This is **i6** – architectural refactoring to break down the monolith into microservices with a unified API gateway.

## Overview

Migrate from monolithic architecture to a microservices-based system with proper service boundaries, API gateway, and service mesh.

## Key Components

- API Gateway (Kong/AWS API Gateway)
- Service discovery and registration
- Load balancing and routing
- Authentication/authorization service
- User service
- Content service
- Notification service
- Analytics service

## Migration Strategy

- Identify service boundaries
- Extract services incrementally
- Implement API gateway
- Set up service mesh
- Monitor and optimize
